## Blink Games

### Introduction

Blink Games is an engaging collection of two-player games powered by the Solana Actions SDK. Each
game is crafted as a unique, interactive blockchain experience, packaged as shareable blockchain
actions, or "blinks." These blinks allow players to seamlessly challenge friends, compete in
real-time, and enjoy a decentralized gaming experience directly on the blockchain. Blink Games
brings the thrill of gaming to the blockchain, making play sessions both shareable and secure.
